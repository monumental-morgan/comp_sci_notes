# Naming Conventions

-   Where an existing library has a different style, internal consistency is preferred
    
-   Never use the characters ‘l’ (lowercase letter el), ‘O’ (uppercase letter oh), or ‘I’ (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
    
-   Class names should normally use the CapWords convention.
    
-   Function & variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
