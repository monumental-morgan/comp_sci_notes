# Microcontrollers
- Microcontroller: Small computer that can be programmed to preform specific tasks
- ESP32 (I believe wifi?) and arduino are two types with lots of support
- Micro python is a language to program mirocontrollers like the Pico and ESP32
    - Easier than C++
- [[ESP32]]
    - ESP32 developed by Espressif Systems
        - Used in Internet of Things (IOT)
        - Wifi and bluetooth support
        - You can also deploy a small webserver on the board to use the tcp/ip networking protocol
- Arduino
    - Arduino is an open-source platform that consists of hardware (microcontrollers) & software (the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE))
        - Has a large selection of pre-designed circuits, called "shields"
            - Can be added on to the microcontroller to give it new capabilities
        - Good for prototyping UGV's (Unmanned Ground Vehicles)
- Raspberry Pi Pico
    - Smaller & more affordable microcontroller
    - Programmed in C++
