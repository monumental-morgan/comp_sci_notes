# 2.8/9 Module Basics

## Modules

- A **module** is a file containing Python code that can be used by other modules or scripts.
- Programmer first imports module at beginning of file
- A module is made available for use via the **import** statement.
- Once a module is imported, any object defined in that module can be accessed using **dot notation**.
    - Ex: A variable speed_of_light defined in universe.py is accessed via universe.speed_of_light.
- Many python modules come with python as part of the standard library
- The [Python Documentation](http://docs.python.org/py3k/) site for Python version 3 is an extremely useful reference for all aspects of Python
- The site contains a listing of all the standard modules that are available with Python (see [Global Module Index](http://docs.python.org/py3k/py-modindex.html))
- You will also see that there is a [Language Reference](http://docs.python.org/py3k/reference/index.html) and a [Tutorial](http://docs.python.org/py3k/tutorial/index.html) (mostly aimed at people who are already familiar with another programming language), as well as installation instructions, how-tos, and frequently asked questions

## Importing Modules and Scripts
- One of the most important things to realize about modules is the fact that they are data objects, just like any other data in Python
- The first thing we need to do when we wish to use a module is perform an `import`
    - the statement `import turtle` creates a new name, `turtle`, and makes it refer to a module object
- In order to use something contained in a module, we use the **dot
 notation**, providing the module name and the specific item joined together with a “dot”.
    - to use the `Turtle`class, we say `turtle.Turtle`
### Importing Modules and Scripts
    - if the value of **_name_** is **_main_** then the file was executed as a script.
