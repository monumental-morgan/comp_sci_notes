# 4.8 Comparing data types and common errors

### Comparing characters, strings, and floating-point types

- The relational and equality operators work for integer, character, and floating-point built-in types.
    - Floating-point types should not be compared using the equality operators, due to the imprecise representation of floating-point numbers
- Numbers are arithmetically compared.
