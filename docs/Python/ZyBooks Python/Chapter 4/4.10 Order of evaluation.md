### Common Error: Missing parentheses

- Good practice is to use parentheses in expressions to make the intended order of evaluation explicit.
- Examples:
    - not a == b intending to mean (not a) == b, but in fact the interpreter computes not (a == b)
    - w and x == y and z intending (w and x) == (y and z), but the interpreter computes (w and (x == y)) and z
    - not x + y < 5 intending (not x) + y < 5, but the interpreter computes not ((x + y) < 5)
