# 5.6 Counting using range() function

- The range() function allows counting in for loops as well.
- **range()** generates a sequence of integers between a starting integer that **is** included in the range, an ending integer that is **not** included in the range, and an integer step value.
- The sequence is generated by starting at the start integer and incrementing by the step value until the ending integer is reached or surpassed.
- The range() function can take up to three integer arguments:
    - `range(Y)` generates a sequence of all non-negative integers less than Y.
    Ex: `range(3)` creates the sequence 0, 1, 2.
    - `range(X, Y)` generates a sequence of all integers >= X and < Y.
    Ex: `range(-7, -3)` creates the sequence -7, -6, -5, -4.
    - `range(X, Y, Z)`, where Z is positive, generates a sequence of all integers >= X and < Y, incrementing by Z.
    Ex: `range(0, 50, 10)` creates the sequence 0, 10, 20, 30, 40.
    - `range(X, Y, Z)`, where Z is negative, generates a sequence of all integers <= X and > Y, incrementing by Z.
    Ex: `range(3, -1, -1)` creates the sequence 3, 2, 1, 0.
