# 3.3 Tuple Basics

- **Tuples** behaves similar to a list but is immutable â€“ once created the tuple's elements cannot be changed
- A tuple is also a sequence type, supporting len(), indexing, and other sequence type functions
- Typically, tuples are surrounded with parentheses, as in (5, 15, 20)
- **Recall that a tuple doesn't require parentheses around the contents, as the comma indicates a tuple should be created**

## Named Tuples

- A **named tuple** allows the programmer to define a new simple data type that consists of named attributes
    - **A Car named tuple with fields like Car.price and Car.horsepower would more clearly represent a car object than a list with index positions correlating to some attributes.**
- The **namedtuple** package must be imported to create a new named tuple.

- namedtuple() only creates the new simple data type, and does not create new data objects. Above, a new data object is not created until Car() is called with appropriate values. A data object's attributes can be accessed using dot notation, as in chevy_blazer.price. This "named" attribute is simpler to read than if using a list or tuple referenced via index like chevy_blazer[2].
