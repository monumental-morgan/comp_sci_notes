# 6.15 Multiple Function Output

- Occasionally a function should produce multiple output values
- However, function return statements are limited to returning only one value.
- A workaround is to package the multiple outputs into a single container, commonly a tuple, and to then return that container.

- Recall that a tuple doesn't require parentheses around the contents, as the comma indicates a tuple should be created
- The outputs could also have been returned in a list, as in return [mean, std_dev].
- The statement average, standard_deviation = get_grade_stats(student_scores) utilizes **unpacking** to perform multiple assignments at once, so that average and standard_deviation are assigned the first and second elements from the returned tuple.
