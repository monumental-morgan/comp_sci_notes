### Modular Program Development

- **Modular development** is the process of dividing a program into separate modules that can be developed and tested separately and then integrated into a single program.
    - A programmer can use **function stubs** (described in depth elsewhere) to capture the high-level behavior of the required functions (or modules) before diving into details of each function, like planning a route for a road trip before starting to drive.

### Avoid writing redundant code

- A function can be defined once, then called from multiple places in a program, thus avoiding redundant code
    - Examples of such functions are math module functions like sqrt() that make it to where square root doesn't need to be programmed each time
- **The skill of decomposing a program's behavior into a good set of functions is a fundamental part of programming that helps characterize a good programmer.**
- Each function should have easily-recognizable behavior, and the behavior of the main program should be easily understandable via the sequence of function calls.
- **A general guideline (especially for beginner programmers) is that a function's definition usually shouldn't have more than about 30 lines of code, although this guideline is not a strict rule.**
