# 6.9 Functions: Common Errors

### Copy-paste errors

- A **common error** is to copy-and-paste code among functions but then not complete all necessary modifications to the pasted code.
    - For example, a programmer might have developed and tested a function to convert a temperature value in Celsius to Fahrenheit, and then copied and modified the original function into a new function to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius as shown:

The programmer forgot to change the return statement to return Celsius rather than Fahrenheit.

### Return Errors

- Another **common error** is to return the wrong variable, like if return temperature had been used in the temperature conversion program by accident. The function will work and sometimes even return the correct value.
- Another **common error** is to fail to return a value for a function.
