# 6.10 Scope of variables and functions

- A variable or function object is only visible to part of a program, known as the object's **scope**.
- When a variable is created inside a function, the variable's scope is limited to *inside* that function.
    - Because a variable's name does not exist until bound to an object, the variable's scope is actually limited to after the first assignment of the variable until the end of the function.

- Such variables defined inside a function are called **local variables.**

### Global variables

- In contrast, a variable defined outside of a function is called a **global variable.**
- A global variable's scope extends from assignment to the end of the file and can be accessed inside of functions.
- A **global statement** must be used to change the value of a global variable inside of a function.

- To be able to call a function, the interpreter must have already evaluated the function definition (thus binding the function name to a function object).
