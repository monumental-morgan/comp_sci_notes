# 6.3 Dynamic Typing

### Dynamic and static typing

- A programmer can pass any type of object as an argument to a function.
- Example add() function can be used for int and strings

- The function's behavior of being able to add together different types is a concept called **polymorphism**.
- **Python** uses **dynamic typing** to determine the type of objects as a program executes
- In contrast to dynamic typing, many other languages like **C, C++,** and **Java** use **static typing**, which requires the programmer to define the type of every variable and every function parameter in a program's source code
- Dynamic typing typically allows for more flexibility in terms of the code that a programmer can write, but at the expense of potentially introducing more bugs, since there is no compilation process by which types can be checked.
