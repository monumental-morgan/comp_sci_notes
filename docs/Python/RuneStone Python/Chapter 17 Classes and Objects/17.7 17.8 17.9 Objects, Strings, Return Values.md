# 17.7, 17.8, 17.9: Objects, Strings, Return Values
# 17.7 Objects as Arguements and Parameters
- You can use the object/classes as arguments in a functions
- Function calling the Point object we created:
```python
def distance(point1, point2):
    xdiff = point2.getX() - point1.getX()
    ydiff = point2.getY() - point1.getY()
    
    dist = math.sqrt(xdiff**2 + ydiff**2)
    return dist
    
p = Point(4, 3)
q = Point(0, 0)
print(distance(p, q))
```

    5.0

-   `distance` takes two points and returns the distance between them.
-   Note that `distance` is **not** a method of the Point class, it is a standalone function.
# 17.8 Converting an Object to a String
- When weâ€™re working with classes and objects, it is often necessary to print an object (that is to print the state of an object).
### Example
- The default print statement for an object is to tell you the type the object is.
```python
class Point:
	""" Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """
    
    def __init__(self, initX, initY):
        """ Create a new point at the given coordinates. """
        self.x = initX
        self.y = initY
    
    def getX(self):
        return self.x
    
    def getY(self):
        return self.y
    
    def distanceFromOrigin(self):
        return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5
    
    
p = Point(7, 6)
print(p)
```

    <__main__.Point object>

- It does not tell you anything about the specific state of the point.
- We can improve on this representation if we include a special method call `__str__` in the Point object/class
- `_str__ method` is responsible for returning a string representation as defined by the class creator.
- You as the programmer, get to choose what a `Point` should look like when it gets printed.
```python
class Point:
    """ Point class for representing and manipulating x,y coordinates. """
    
    def __init__(self, initX, initY):
        """ Create a new point at the given coordinates. """
        self.x = initX
        self.y = initY
    
    def getX(self):
        return self.x
    
    def getY(self):
        return self.y
    
    def distanceFromOrigin(self):
        return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "x=" + str(self.x) + ", y=" + str(self.y)
    
p = Point(7, 6)
print(p)
```

    x=7, y=6

# 17.9 Instances as Return Values
- Functions and methods can return objects (Obviously)
- **Example:** Have a point object and wish to find the midpoint halfway between it and some other target point.
- Method, called `halfway` that takes another `Point` as a parameter and returns the `Point` that is halfway between the point and the target.
```python
class Point:
    
    def __init__(self, initX, initY):
        """ Create a new point at the given coordinates. """
        self.x = initX
        self.y = initY
    
    def getX(self):
        return self.x
    
    def getY(self):
        return self.y
    
    def distanceFromOrigin(self):
        return ((self.x ** 2) + (self.y ** 2)) ** 0.5
    
    def __str__(self):
        return "x=" + str(self.x) + ", y=" + str(self.y)
    
    def halfway(self, target):
        mx = (self.x + target.x) / 2
        my = (self.y + target.y) / 2
        return Point(mx, my)
    
p = Point(3, 4)
q = Point(5, 12)
mid = p.halfway(q)
    
print(mid)
print(mid.getX())
print(mid.getY())
```
