# 11.6 Writing Text Files
Note in [Table 1](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/CS152-AshleyGosseen-Fall1-2022/Files/intro-WorkingwithDataFiles.html#filemethods1a) in 11.1 that the only difference between opening a file for writing and opening a file for reading is the use of the  `w` flag instead of the `r` flag as the second parameter.
- `open(filename,'r')` for open and read a file
- `open(filename,'w')` for open and write a file
- `filevariable.close()` close a file

- [Table 2](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/CS152-AshleyGosseen-Fall1-2022/Files/AlternativeFileReadingMethods.html#filemethods2a) in 11.5 shows the `write` function to add data to text file.
- Notice that the `write` method takes one parameter, a string.
    - When used, the characters of the string will be added to the end of the file.
    - YOUR job to add a newline if desired
        - When writing, you need to include a newline `\n`
- Example in the title, then a good while loop example
```python
infile = open("ccdata.txt", "r")
aline = infile.readline()
print("Year\tEmmision\n")
while aline:
    items = aline.split()
    dataline = items[0] + '\t' + items[2]
    print(dataline)
    aline = infile.readline()
    
infile.close()
```

# Creating an output file
- To start, we need to open a new output file by adding another call to the `open` function, `outfile = open("emissiondata.txt",'w')`, using the `w` flag.
- We can choose any file name we like. If the file does not exist, it will be created. However, if the file does exist, it will be overwritten
- Once the file has been created, we just need to call the `write` method passing the string that we wish to add to the file.
- In the previous case, the string is already being printed so we will just change the `print` into a `write` method.
	- A newline needs to be added as well
```python
infile = open("ccdata.txt", "r")
outfile = open("emissiondata.txt", "w")
    
aline = infile.readline()
outfile.write("Year \tEmmision\n")
while aline:
    items = aline.split()
    dataline = items[0] + '\t' + items[2]
    outfile.write(dataline + '\n')
    aline = infile.readline()
    
infile.close()
outfile.close()
```
