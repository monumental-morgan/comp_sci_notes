# 11.7 11.8 With Statements and Web Fetching
- The with method automatically closes the file when finished, which is good, cause people forget
- Context Manager
- Automates the process of doing common operations at the start of some tasks, as well as automating some operations at the end of some tasks.
- The Python with statement makes using context managers easy. The general form of a with statement is:  
```python
with <create some object that understands context> as <some name>:
	do some stuff with the object
    ...
```  
- When the program exits the with block, the context manager handles the common stuff that normally happens. For example closing a file.
### Example
```python
mydata.txt
1 2 3
4 5 6 
```  

```python
with open('mydata.txt') as md:
    print(md)
    for line in md:
        print(line)
print(md)
```

    <openfile 'mydata.txt', mode 'r'>
    1 2 3
    
    4 5 6
    
    <closedfile 'mydata.txt', mode 'r'>

# 11.8 Fetching Something From The Web
- We’ll need permission to write to the destination filename, and the file will be created in the “current directory” - i.e. the same folder that the Python program is saved in.
- If we are behind a proxy server that requires authentication, (as some students are), this may require some more special handling to work around our proxy. Use a local resource for the purpose of this demonstration!
- We will try to retrieve the content of the HTML of this page as in the following code.
```python
import urllib.request
    
def retrieve_page(url):
    """ Retrieve the contents of a web page.
    """
    my_socket = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
    dta = my_socket.read()
    return dta
    
the_text = retrieve_page("https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/Files/FetchingSomethingFromTheWeb.html")
print(the_text)
```
