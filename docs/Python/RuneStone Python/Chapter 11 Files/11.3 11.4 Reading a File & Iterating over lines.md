# 11.3 Reading a File

- To open this file, we would call the `open` function
- The variable, `fileref` , now holds a reference to the file object returned by `open`
- When we are finished with the file, we can close it by using the `close` method.
    - After the file is closed any further attempts to use `fileref` will result in an error.

```python
>>>fileref = open("ccdata.txt", "r")
>>>
>>>fileref.close()
>>>
```

# 11.4 Iterating over lines in a file

- Example file:

![[Pasted image 20230519154606.png]]

- Example code for file

```python
ccfile = open("ccdata.txt", "r")

for aline in ccfile:
    values = aline.split()
    print('In', values[0], 'the average temp. was', values[1], '°C and CO2 emmisions were', values[2], 'gigatons.')

ccfile.close()
```

```
