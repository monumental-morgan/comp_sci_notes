# 11.1/11.2 Locating and Working with Files

# 11.1 Working With Data Files

- In Python, we must **open** files before we can use them and **close** them when we are done with them
- Once a file is opened it becomes a Python object just like all other data

# 11.2 Finding a File on your Disk

- Hereâ€™s the important rule to remember: If your file and your Python program are in the same directory you can simply use the filename like this: `open('myfile.txt', 'r')`
- If your file and your Python program are in different directories then you must refer to one or more directories:
    - in a *relative file path* to the file like this: `open('../myData/data3.txt', 'r')`
    - or in an *absolute file path* like `open('/users/bmiller/myFiles/allProjects/myData/data3.txt', 'r')`
