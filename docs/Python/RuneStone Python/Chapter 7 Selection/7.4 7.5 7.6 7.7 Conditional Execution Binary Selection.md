# 7.4/5/6/7 Conditional Execution: Binary Selection

- In order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly.

# **Selection Statements (Conditional Statements)**

## `if` statement

Structure of an `if` statement

```python
if BOOLEAN EXPRESSION:
    STATEMENTS_1        # executed if condition evaluates to True
else:
    STATEMENTS_2        # executed if condition evaluates to False
```

Example

```python
x = 15

if x % 2 == 0:
    print(x, "is even")
else:
    print(x, "is odd")
```

### Unary Selection

- The `else`clause is omitted entirely
- When the condition evaluates to `True`, the statements are executed.
- Otherwise the flow of execution continues to the statement after the body of the `if`
- Example:

```python
x = 10
if x < 0:
    print("The negative number ",  x, " is not valid here.")
print("This is always printed")
```

# 7.6 Nested Conditionals

- One conditional can be nested within another.

```python
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
else:
    if x > y:
        print("x is greater than y")
    else:
        print("x and y must be equal")
```

# 7.7 Chained Conditionals

```python
if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")
elif x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x and y must be equal")
```

- Exactly one branch will be executed.
- `elif`is an abbreviation of `else if`
- There is no limit of the number of `elif`statements
- only a single (and optional) final `else`statement is allowed and it must be the last branch in the statement.
- Each condition is checked in order
- If the first is false, the next is checked, and so on, until one is true, branch executes, then conditional is over.
