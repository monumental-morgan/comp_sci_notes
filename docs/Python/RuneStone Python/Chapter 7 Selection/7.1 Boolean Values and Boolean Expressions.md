# 7.1 Boolean Values and Boolean Expressions

- The Python type for storing true and false values is called `bool`
- George Boole created *Boolean Algebra*, which is the basis of all modern computer arithmetic.
- There are only two **boolean values**
    - True
    - False
- Capitalization is important, since `true`and `false`are not boolean values
    - (remember Python is case sensitive).
- Boolean values are not strings!

### boolean expression

- A **boolean expression** is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value.
- The equality operator, `==`, compares two values
    - produces a boolean value (True or False) related to whether the two values are equal to one another.

## Quick Note

- The `==` operator is one of six common **comparison operators**; the others are:

```python
x != y               # x is not equal to y
x > y                # x is greater than y
x < y                # x is less than y
x >= y               # x is greater than or equal to y
x <= y               # x is less than or equal to y
```

- Remember that `=`is an assignment operator and `==`is a comparison operator
- there is no such thing as `=<`or `=>`
