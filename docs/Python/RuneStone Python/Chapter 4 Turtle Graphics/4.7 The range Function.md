# 4.7 The range Function

- When called with one parameter, the sequence provided by `range`always starts with 0
- If you ask for `range(4)`, then you will get 4 values starting with 0
    - 0, 1, 2, and finally 3
    - 4 is not included since we started with 0

```python
for i in range(4):
    # Executes the body with i = 0, then 1, then 2, then 3
for x in range(10):
    # sets x to each of ... [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

```python
for i in range(4):
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)
```

## Two parameter Range

- The evaluation of `range(1,5)` produces the desired sequence of 1-4
- we interpret the parameters of the range function to mean `range(start,beyondLast)`
    - beyondLast means an index past the last index we want: 4+1

## Three Parameter Ranges

- Third parameter: step
- Tells the range what to count by
- So if we wanted the first 10 even numbers we would use `range(0,19,2)`
- The most general form of the range is `range(start, beyondLast, step)`
- You can also create a sequence of numbers that starts big and gets smaller by using a negative value for the step parameter.

```python
print(list(range(0, 19, 2)))
print(list(range(0, 20, 2)))
print(list(range(10, 0, -1)))
```
