# 4.6 Iteration Simplifies our Turtle Program

- To draw a square we’d like to do the same thing four times — move the turtle forward some distance and turn 90 degrees.

```python
import turtle            # set up alex
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:      # repeat four times
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
```

The values [0,1,2,3] were provided to make the loop body execute 4 times. We could have used any four values. For example, consider the following program.

```python
import turtle            # set up alex
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:      # repeat four times
    alex.forward(50)
    alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
```

- Since there are four items in the list, the iteration will still occur four times.  `aColor`will take on each color in the list.
- We can even take this one step further and use the value of `aColor`as part of the computation

```python
import turtle            # set up alex
wn = turtle.Screen()
alex = turtle.Turtle()

for aColor in ["yellow", "red", "purple", "blue"]:
   alex.color(aColor)
   alex.forward(50)
   alex.left(90)

wn.exitonclick()
```

- In this case, the value of `aColor`is used to change the color attribute of `alex`
    - Each iteration causes `aColor`to change to the next value in the list.
