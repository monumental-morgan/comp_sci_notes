# 5.3 Math Module

- The `math`module contains the kinds of mathematical functions you would typically find on your calculator and some mathematical constants like *pi* and *e*
- As we noted above, when we `import math`, we create a reference to a module object that contains these elements.
- If you want more information, you can check out the [Math Module](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/math.html#module-math) Python Documentation.
- Mathematical functions do not need to be constructed. They simply perform a task. They are all housed together in a module called math.

```python
import math

print(math.pi)
print(math.e)

print(math.sqrt(2.0))

print(math.sin(math.radians(90)))   # sin of 90 degrees
```

- Contains number of math stuff: trig, log, etc
- **Function**: list of statements that can be executed simply by referring to the function's name.
- The process of invoking a function is referred to as a **function call**.
- The item passed to a function is referred to as an **argument**.
