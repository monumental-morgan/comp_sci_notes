# 2.2 HTML Boilerplate 
(Basic Structure)
-  Always start the homepage of a website with `index.html`
    - It is worth noting that we named our HTML file `index`. We should always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our websites `index.html`. This is because web servers will by default look for an `index.html` page when users land on our websites - and not having one will cause big problems.
        

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

## The DOCTYPE

-   Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration. The doctypeâ€™s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document.
    
-   The latest version of HTML is HTML 5. Doctype: `<!DOCTYPE html>`
    

## HTML Element

-   After doctype we must provide an `<html>` element. This is the root element of the document, every other element in the doc is a descendant of the `<html>` element.
    
    -   Included in every document
        

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
</html>
```

## `lang` attribute

-   Specifies the language of the text content in the element
    
    -   Since this element encompasses the whole page, it specifies the language for the whole document
        
-   Helps with assistive technologies (screen readers)
    

## Head Element

-   The `<head>` element is where we put important meta-info about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser
    
-   There should not be any elements that display content on the webpage
    

## Charset Meta Element

-   Always have the meta tag for the charset encoding of the webpage in the head element:
    
    -   `<meta charset= "utf-8">`
        
-   Very important because it ensures that the webpage will display special symbols and characters correctly in the browser
    

## Title Element

-   Always in the head element
    
    -   Ex: `<title>My First Webpage</title>`
        
-   Gives the browser tab a name
    
-   If no title is given, it will just say `index.html`
    

## Body Element

-   The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate is the `<body>` element.
    
-   This is where all the content displayed to the users will go
    
    -   text, images, lists, links, etc
        
-   The body element is also within the HTML element and is always below the head element
