# Anchor Elements

-   Creates a link in HTML
    

```
<a>click me</a>
```

-   An HTML attribute gives additional info to the element that goes in the opening tag
    
-   Add a href (hyperlink reference) attribute to the opening anchor tag
    

```
<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>
```

-   By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a `href` attribute will look like plain text.
    
-   If the `href` attribute is present, the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a link.
    
-   Can link to videos, pdf files, images, etc, but for the most part, you will be linking to other HTML documents
    

# Absolute and Relative Links

## Absolute Links

-   Links to pages on other websites
    

## Relative Links

-   Links to other pages within our own website
    
-   Relative links do not include the domain name
    
-   Since it is another page on the same site, it assumes the domain name will be the same as the page we created the link on.
    
-   Relative links only include the file path to the other page, _relative_ to the page you are creating the link on.
    

```
<body>
  <h1>Homepage</h1>
	<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">click me</a>

	<a href="about.html">About</a>
</body>
```

-   This works because the index and about page are in the same directory.
    
-   We can simply use its name (`about.html`) as the linkâ€™s href value.
    
-   Normally we would only have the index.html at the root directory and all other HTML files in their own directory.
    

```
<body>
  <h1>Homepage</h1>
  <a href="pages/about.html">About</a>
</body>
```

### If this doesn't work:

-   You can still run into unexpected issues with this approach
    
-   Putting `./` before the link will in most cases prevent such issues
    

# Images

-   To display an image in HTML we use the `<img>` element.
    
-   The `<img>` element is self-closing.
    
-   Empty, self-closing HTML elements do not need a closing tag.
    

-   Instead of wrapping content with an opening and closing tag, it embeds an image into the page using a src attribute which tells the browser where the image file is located.
    
-   The src attribute works like the href attribute for anchor tags
    
-   It can embed an images using absolute or relative links
    

### Absolute

```
 <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png">
```

### Relative

```
<img src="images/dog.jpg">
```

## Using images in other directories

-   If you're in a subfoldered HTML file, you will have to get the images folder all the way from the parent directory
    
-   To go to the parent directory we need to use two dots in the relative filepath like this: `../`
    

```
<img src="../images/dog.jpg">
```

To break this down:

1.  First, we are going to the parent directory of the pages directory which is `odin-links-and-images`.
    
2.  Then, from the parent directory, we can go into the `images` directory.
    
3.  Finally, we can access the `dog.jpg` file.
    

## Alt Attribute

-   Besides the src attribute, every image element should also have an alt (alternative text) attribute
    
-   The alt attribute is used to describe an image
    
-   It will be used in place of the image if it cannot be loaded.
    
-   It is also used with screen readers to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.
    

```
 <img src="https://www.theodinproject.com/mstile-310x310.png" alt="The Odin Project Logo">
```

# Notes:

There are 4 main image formats in use on the web and they all do different things:

1.  JPG
    
    -   Designed for handling larger color palettes without massively increasing file size
        
    -   No transparent pixels, so you can see white edges
        
    -   Great for photos
        
2.  GIF
    
    -   Low level of details
        
    -   Used for simple animation
        
3.  PNG
    
    -   Allows for transparent pixels
        
    -   Great for icons, tech diagrams, logos, etc.
        
4.  SVG
    
    -   Unlike pixel based above, SVG is vector based, which allows it to scale without loss of quality
        
    -   Great for responsive design
        
    -   Great replacement for PNG, EXCEPT:
        
        -   There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently across browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your image editor
            
        -   If your images contain a lot of text (like the fancy screenshots in this tutorial), this can have a big impact on file size.
