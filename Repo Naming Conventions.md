"The problem with camel case is that there are often different interpretations of words - for example, checkinService vs checkInService. Going along with Aaron's answer, it is difficult with auto-completion if you have many similarly named repos to have to constantly check if the person who created the repo you care about used a certain breakdown of the upper and lower cases. avoid upper case.

His point about dashes is also well-advised.

1.  use lower case.
    
2.  use dashes.
    
3.  be specific. you may find you have to differentiate between similar ideas later - ie use purchase-rest-service instead of service or rest-service.
    
4.  be consistent. consider usage from the various GIT vendors - how do you want your repositories to be sorted/grouped?"
